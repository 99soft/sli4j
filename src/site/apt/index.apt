Introduction

  The <<sli4j>>, achronimous of <Simple Logger Injector for Java>, is a small,
  light and fast logger Injector, built on top of <Google-Guice>, for the well
  known frameworks:

  * Java Utils Logging;

  * Apache {{{http://commons.apache.org/logging/}commons-logging}};

  * Apache {{{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/}log4j}};

  * Simple Logging Facade for Java {{{http://www.slf4j.org/}slf4j}}.

  The concept behind <<sli4j>> is that instead of creating Loggers by hand,
  users can let <Guice> creates and injects them automagically, for example
  instead writing:

+--------------------------------------+
import java.util.logging.Logger;
...
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(this.getClass().getName());
...
+--------------------------------------+

  users can easily code:

+--------------------------------------+
import java.util.logging.Logger;
...
@InjectLogger
Logger logger;
...
+--------------------------------------+

  and <<nothing>> more! <<No>> setter methods are needed, just declare it, annotate with <<<@InjectLogger>>>
  annotation let <sli4j> doing the rest, <<<final>>> and already set
  Loggers will be skipped and <sli4j> won't try to override them at all.

Acknowledgements

  This work is dedicated to our city, L'Aquila, destroyed by a terrible
  earthquake the 6th April, 2009... That day more than 300 people were killed
  because buildings collapsed after a magnitudo 6.3 earthquake at 3:32 am.

  We'll never forget that episode.
